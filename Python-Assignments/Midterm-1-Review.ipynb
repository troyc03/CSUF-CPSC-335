    "## **Implementation of an Algorithm**  \n",
    "\n",
    "An **implementation** of an algorithm is its translation into an executable computer program using a programming language. It follows the structure of the algorithm while adapting it to the syntax and constraints of the chosen language. A good implementation should be:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Correct** – It should faithfully execute the logic of the algorithm.  \n",
    "- **Efficient** – It should minimize unnecessary computations and resource usage.  \n",
    "- **Readable & Maintainable** – The code should be clear, well-commented, and structured for easy debugging and modification.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example Implementation: Filtering Positive Numbers**  \n",
    "\n",
    "The following Python function implements an algorithm that filters out non-positive numbers from a given list:  \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def keep_positives(S):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Returns a list of only positive numbers from S.\"\"\"\n",
    "    if not S:  # Checks if the list is empty\n",
    "        return []  # Returns an empty list instead of 0 for consistency\n",
    "    result = [i for i in S if i > 0]  # List comprehension for concise filtering\n",
    "    return result\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example usage\n",
    "numbers = [-3, 5, 0, 9, -1, 7, -2]\n",
    "print(keep_positives(numbers))  # Output: [5, 9, 7]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Breakdown of the Implementation**  \n",
    "1. **Base Case Handling:**  \n",
    "   - The function checks if `S` is empty (`not S` is a Pythonic way to check for an empty list).  \n",
    "   - Instead of returning `0`, it returns an empty list `[]`, maintaining type consistency.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Iterating Through the List:**  \n",
    "   - A **list comprehension** (`[i for i in S if i > 0]`) is used to efficiently filter out negative numbers and zeros.  \n",
    "   - This is a more Pythonic and optimized approach compared to using a loop with `.append()`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Returning the Result:**  \n",
    "   - The function returns a new list containing only the positive numbers.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Performance Consideration**  \n",
    "- The function runs in **O(n) time complexity**, where **n** is the length of `S`, since it iterates over the entire list once.  \n",
    "- The **space complexity** is also **O(n)** in the worst case, as it creates a new list of up to `n` elements.  \n",

    "**Pseudocode** is a human-readable format for communicating algorithms that may include code-like syntax, math notation, and prose. Please note that an algorithm is a kind of process, and there are many ways of communicating processes, such as step-by-step instructions, flowcharts, diagrams, and recipes. Though, the most efficient way of representing algorithms is with pseudocode. \n",
    "\n",
    "Writing and interpreting pseudocode must follow the given guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input and output**: Are the algorithm’s inputs and outputs clear, and explicitly separated from other variables? Arguments should\n",
    "correspond to problem inputs; return value corresponds to problem output.\n",
    "2. **Undefined variables**: Are any variables used before they are defined or initialized?\n",
    "3. **Variable meanings**: Is the intended meaning of every variable clear? Potentially-confusing variables should be explained with a\n",
    "comment\n",
    "4. **Defined return value**: Does every execution path have a defined return value?\n",
    "5. **Return value data type**: Does the data type of every returned value match the output in the problem definition?\n",
    "6. **Handles all cases**: Does your algorithm have the potential to return every kind of valid output?\n",
    "7. **Loop termination**: Does every loop have a termination condition that prevents infinite loops?\n",
    "8. **Base case**: Does every recursive function have a clearly-defined base case?\n",
    "9. **Repetitive code**: Repetitive code should be moved into a helper function or loop.\n",
    "10. **Dead code**: Delete code that is never executed.\n",
    "11. **Vagueness**: Are any steps vague? Check that every line of pseudocode could be translated into program code without elaboration."
