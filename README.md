## In-Class Presentation

### CPSC 335: Algorithm Engineering
### Spring 2025
### Class Presentation Assignment
- Points: 100
- Due Date: 02/23

Each group will research and present details of one of the algorithms below. The goal of the
assignment is to assist students to acquire technical presentation skills, in a fast-paced, peer-review
environment as well as gain further knowledge of some relatively unknown algorithms. In addition
to other information of your choice, below are some of the things you may include in your
presentation:

-  1. An overview of the algorithm, usage, and areas of Computer Science where it can be
   applied
-  2. A high-level summary showing how the algorithm works.
-  3. A correctness argument: do you think the algorithm is correct or not?
-  4. A short example to buttress your assertion in 3 above
-  5. If possible, a graphical representation (e.g., pictures or an animation) of the algorithmâ€™s
   implementation.
-  6. A complexity analysis of your algorithm

Assume that your audience is unfamiliar with your algorithm. Include any detail that may assist
the audience to grasp the essence of the algorithm.

**NOTE**: Your presentation will be evaluated on its content, clarity, and the level of research, as shown by
your submission, as well as your ability to answer audience questions. Your presentation should
not exceed 12 minutes, to be followed by a 3-minute Q&A from the audience.

Submit your presentation slides (not pdf) to Class Presentation Assignment on Canvas, on or
before the due date.
